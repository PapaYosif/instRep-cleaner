# why
If you have nvidia gefore and you enable instant replay nvidia creates a folder for each supported game you play inside the nvidia folder. Even if you've never saved any videos. This is annoying to me as after a while its quite hard to find the folder youre looking for.
Also i like my folders clean.
## why rust
